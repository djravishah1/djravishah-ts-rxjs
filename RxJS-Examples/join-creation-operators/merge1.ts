//Merge together 3 Observables, but only 2 run concurrently
// Results in the following:
// - First timer1 and timer2 will run concurrently
// - timer1 will emit a value every 1000ms for 10 iterations
// - timer2 will emit a value every 2000ms for 6 iterations
// - after timer1 hits its max iteration, timer2 will
//   continue, and timer3 will start to run concurrently with timer2
// - when timer2 hits its max iteration it terminates, and
//   timer3 will continue to emit a value every 500ms until it is complete
